* About
- happy is a parser generator for haskell. like yacc/bison is for C.
- it was written in emacs, so it may not play nicely with other editors. just make sure that things line up properly
** Requirements
- This program requires cabal and happy, and ghc obviously
- ghc and cabal can be install using pacman on arch, probably apt-get on ubuntu or whatever ari uses
** Happy
   - install happy using:
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     cabal update
     cabal install happy
     #+END_EXAMPLE
     it may sit there for a while, but it's doing stuff
** Building
   - i havent set this up in cabal yet for easy of development, so compile it manually
   - to compile this, run:
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   happy Parser.y && ghc Parser.hs
   #+END_EXAMPLE
*** Remember
    To install libraries, run
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    cabal install /package/
    #+END_EXAMPLE
