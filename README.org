* About
- happy is a parser generator for haskell. like yacc/bison is for C.
- it was written in emacs, so it may not play nicely with other editors. just make sure that things line up properly
** Requirements
- This program requires cabal and happy, and ghc obviously
- ghc and cabal can be install using pacman on arch, probably apt-get on ubuntu or whatever ari uses
** Happy
   - install happy using:
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     cabal update
     cabal install happy
     #+END_EXAMPLE
     it may sit there for a while, but it's doing stuff
   - then do:
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     cabal build
     #+END_EXAMPLE
     in this directory to build stuff
** Building
   - the executable will be ./dist/build/happydemo/happydemo,
   - and the haskell file generated by happy is in ./dist/build/happydemo/happydemo-tmp/happy2.hs or thereabouts
   - to manually compile this, run: happy happy2.y && ghc happy2.hs
   you'll still need the libraries specified in the happydemo.cabal file
